Mike Hashimoto GT Code Camp 4.27.2017

 Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name is—that is fine and expected.
Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.-->
